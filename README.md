I’m a sucker for positive disruption especially through software that brings together and connects people in different ways. I’m also a kick ass test driven Rails and Javascript Developer, just recently out of the Makers Academy code immersion course which has engrained in me a modern, collaborative & agile approach to coding. I'm sure as hell ready to build on my love for product development through learning and creating the ins and outs of what it takes to build and launch beautiful software. I work best with teams of enthusiastic, optimistic individuals and startups are a plus.

## Skills

### Community Leadership

Using both online and offline resources to consistently grow and engage with a community has become second nature to me.

- [Minival](https://www.facebook.com/minivalofficial) - an entertainment company that host carnival style events - I was involved with marketing, branding and building a consistent following

- Go Tutors - co-founder of Go Tutors which aimed at connecting young graduates to tutoring positions around London and Aberdeen

### Event Management

I love organising and hosting events to promote company culture, branding and community engagement. It's a great way to show followers who you are and where you're going.

- TEDxUnionTerrace [2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Is6xzZkf4&list=PLsRNoUx8w3rMt0281K97CCY5F9vw8CqsX) / [2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOYz8YANfmw&list=PLsRNoUx8w3rMUzriQ3wP0Lu9m9EVCFTLu) - as founder of TEDxUnionTerrace I was head organiser and onstage host of two annual events before passing on the role.

### Team Collaboration & Project Management

Working within teams and managing projects has always been one of my strongest characteristics. I'd like to think I have a good knack for taking the lead when necessary as well as sitting back and being more analytical within a team.

### Test Driven Development (XP)

 I have recently become somewhat enthusiastic about Test Driven Development primarily Ruby on Rails and AngularJS using Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine. Writing SOLID code which leads to beautiful software has somewhat jumped to the top of my interests. Check out some of my personal projects!

## Personal Projects

### Handl

A delivery app which connects cyclists to companies who require packages to be delivered affordably and efficiently. This was a test driven project built in just under two weeks aiming to provide and present a working MVP.

A project based on the dying concept of event poster advertising. What's Good follows a Pinterest based model primarily for events allowing event goers of all ages, in any city to find and attend events they love.

Technologies: AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Ionic, Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine
