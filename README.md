# Sachin Karia


I’m amazing at creating both online and offline marketing campaigns... I’m also a kick ass test driven Rails Developer, just recently out of the Makers Academy code immersion course which has engrained in me a modern, collaborative & agile approach to coding. I work best with groups of optimistic people and early stage startups are a plus.

## Skills

### Community Leadership

At most organisations across every field a common goal is always undertaken; trying to create and grow a community of people who believe in what you're trying to achieve and are willing to follow you there. Utilising both online and offline resources to successfully generate a following has always been a strong point of mine.

### Event Management

Organising and hosting events to promote company culture, branding and community engagement has always been a strong methodology I have believed in. TBC

### Test Driven Development
Test Driven Development primarily Ruby on Rails and AngularJS using RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine. TBC.

## Personal Projects
