I’m a sucker for positive disruption especially through software that brings together and connects people in different ways. I’m also a kick ass Marketer and Sales Executive, just recently out of the Makers Academy code immersion course which has engrained in me a modern, collaborative & agile approach to teamwork and product development. I'm sure as hell ready to build on my love for on the ground Sales and Marketing through learning and creating the ins and outs of what it takes to build and launch beautiful campaigns. I work best with teams of enthusiastic, optimistic individuals and startups are a plus.

## Skills

### Team Collaboration & Project Management

Working within teams and managing projects has always been one of my strongest characteristics. I'd like to think I have a good knack for taking the lead when necessary as well as sitting back and being more analytical within a team.

[Rinedata](http://www.rinedata.com/) - worked within teams as well as leads on projects to successfully implement financial management software around the UK

### Community Leadership and Marketing

Using both online and offline resources to consistently grow and engage with a community has become second nature to me.

- [Minival](https://www.facebook.com/minivalofficial) - an entertainment company that host carnival style events - I was involved with marketing, branding and building a consistent following

- Go Tutors - co-founder of Go Tutors which aimed at connecting young graduates to tutoring positions around London and Aberdeen

### Event Management

I love organising and hosting events to promote company culture, branding and community engagement. It's a great way to show followers who you are and where you're going.

### Test Driven Development (XP)

 I have recently become somewhat enthusiastic about Test Driven Development primarily Ruby on Rails and AngularJS using Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine. Writing SOLID code which leads to beautiful software has somewhat jumped to the top of my interests. Check out some of my personal projects!

## Personal Projects

### Minival

A event platform that was launched in the 2008 in Aberdeen, Scotland. The events quickly expanded and through both progressive branding and community engagement quickly became Scotland's leading electronic music event connecting international artists with Scotland's music lovers through carnival style events and club nights.

### What's Good

A project based on the dying concept of event poster advertising. What's Good follows a Pinterest based model primarily for events allowing event goers of all ages, in any city to find, share and attend events they love.

Technologies: ReactJS, NodeJS, Mocha, Chai, Express, MongoDB
