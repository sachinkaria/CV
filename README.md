# Sachin Karia


I’m a sucker for positive disruption especially through software that brings together and connects people in different ways. I’m also a kick ass test driven Rails Developer, just recently out of the Makers Academy code immersion course which has engrained in me a modern, collaborative & agile approach to coding. In the past I have worked with and founded organisations which have been both successful and unsuccessful. I work best with groups of optimistic people and early stage startups are a plus.

## Skills

### Community Leadership

Utilising both online and offline resources to consistently grow and engage with a community has always been a second nature to me.

### Event Management

I love organising and hosting events to promote company culture, branding and community engagement.

### Test Driven Development
 I have recently become somewhat enthusiastic about Test Driven Development primarily Ruby on Rails and AngularJS using Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine.

## Personal Projects

### Dine with me

A recent project aiming to connect enthusiastic chefs with a dining space to foodies. Creating a community of food lovers through tech enabling them to save money, make money and share food. (Add online/digital platform)

### What's Good

A project based on the dying concept of event poster advertising. What's Good follows a Pinterest based model primarily for events allowing event goers of all ages, in any city to find and attend events they love.
